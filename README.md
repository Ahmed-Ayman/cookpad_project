[The project's Repo](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ayman/cookpad_project). (its public now after the Deadline..)
# about the project:
I have developed this app using the native Java Android libraires and I have used Android studio to do so.

it contains two activites :

1. a simple splash screen.

2. Main acticity that contins two tabs each one has its fragment :
   1. the first tab displays just two days of the weather forecast ...Today and Tomorrow.
   2. the second tab displays 7 days of weather forecast.
* I have used AsyncTasks to do the fetching process in the background thread.
* I have used the shared prefrences to store the city name.
* also I have added a sharing functionality.
* It asks the user if he/she wants to go to the settings to open the wifi if it wasn't working.
* and finally a custom Action bar.

# In order to check my work you can :-
1.clone [the repo](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ayman/cookpad_project) and add your API Key then you can test the application and checout everything in Android studio..
2. if you would just check out the Gist then, I would recommend checking it like the following sequence..

- the Splahs.java  activity and its layout splash_screen.xml  
- the MainActivity and its layout main_activity.xml
- then the tabs (TodayForecastFragment.java  & WeeklyFragment.java )and their laoyuts.
- then there is the adapter (WeatheritemsForecastAdapter.java) : list view adapter.
- the Parsrer which contains a JsonParser method.


here are some pics from the app: (sorry about the resolution by the way..)
