# about the project:
I have developed this app using the native Java Android libraires and I have used Android studio to do so.

it contains two activites :

1. a simple splash screen.

2. Main acticity that contins two tabs each one has its fragment :
   1. the first tab displays just two days of the weather forecast ...Today and Tomorrow.
   2. the second tab displays 7 days of weather forecast.
* I have used AsyncTasks to do the fetching process in the background thread.
* I have used the shared prefrences to store the city name.
* also I have added a sharing functionality.
* It asks the user if he/she wants to go to the settings to open the wifi if it wasn't working.
* and finally a custom Action bar.
